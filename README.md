# ReStyle-MusicVAE - Style Embedded Google MusicVAE

ReStyle-MusicVAE, is a system for human-AI co-creation in music composition. More specifically, ReStyle-MusicVAE combines the automatic melody generation and variation approach of MusicVAE and adds semantic control dimensions to further steer the process. To this end, expert-annotated melody lines created for music production are used to define stylistic anchors, which serve as semantic references for interpolation. We present an easy-to-use web app built on top of the Magenta.js JavaScript library and pre-trained MusicVAE checkpoints.
